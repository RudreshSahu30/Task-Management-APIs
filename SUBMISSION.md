# Submission Summary

## Track Chosen
<!-- Mark your choice with [x] -->
- [X] Backend Only
- [ ] Frontend Only
- [ ] Full-Stack (Both)

## GitHub Copilot Usage Summary
<!-- Describe how you used AI throughout the test. Be specific about when and how you leveraged AI tools. -->

I have give instructions about current existing code architecture.Then provide the requirements which is required to create the project with core instruction to make it optimal and scalable to be adaptable in future requirements.



## Key Prompts Used
<!-- List 3-5 important prompts you used with your AI assistant -->

1. // Create a Task Management Rest API using Node.js and express.

// The project base structure already there in backend directory.so follow that modular architecture given as controller, middleware,routes,etc.

**Requirements **

Implement a RESTful API for task management
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
In-memory data storage (no database)
Input validation and error handling
Follow proper REST conventions
we can create simple operations. but all API's and its respective functions has comment over it to make it clear to other developers.

In case of any doubt if required always ask before implementing it.

Note: it should be optimal and scalable.

2. ** Request Logging Middleware**

Integrate a third-party request logging package (e.g., Morgan, Winston-express, or similar)
Configure the logger to capture all incoming requests
Include request method, URL, and execution time
Log format: [METHOD] /endpoint - Execution time: Xms
ask question in case of doubts.
Note: Make the implementation optimal and scalable. with proper comments.

3. ok , I think we are already have this **Advanced Validation**
Implement custom validation rules (e.g., title length constraints, due dates)
Add request body sanitization
Return detailed validation error messages
Could you please confirm and if not please add this as well.

## Design Decisions (optional)
<!-- Explain key architectural or implementation decisions you made and why -->

- **Decision 1:** [e.g., "Used a singleton service for in-memory task storage"]
  - **Reasoning:** [e.g., "To maintain state consistency across API calls without a database"]

- **Decision 2:** [e.g., "Implemented reactive forms instead of template-driven"]
  - **Reasoning:** [e.g., "Better type safety and validation control"]

- **Decision 3:** 
  - **Reasoning:**
